# Book Searcher

## Purpose
For this challege I wanted to refactor code from using RESTful APIs to using GraphQl APIs. I added TypeDefs, resolvers, queries, and mutations. A user can signup, login, add a book, and delete a book. After refactoring, all of these mutations and queries are still working but now with GraphQl.
